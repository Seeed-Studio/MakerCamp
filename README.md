Maker culture has been on the rise in recent years, and Shenzhen has been leading the way in innovation. Each year, Seeed Studio and Chaihuo welcome global makers to explore Shenzhen's tech ecosystem and abundant community resources. Maker Camp in Shenzhen is a unique opportunity for makers to explore the tech ecosystem in Shenzhen and engage in hands-on learning experiences while creating open-source, hardware-based projects that can positively impact society.

## What's in the Mix

Dreaming of leveraging world-class supply chains, electronic technologies, rapid prototyping services, and a rich open-source community for your project or research? "Maker Camp in Shenzhen" connects your dreams with the limitless possibilities of Shenzhen. Participants in the project will have the opportunity to understand the intricacies of manufacturing processes and supply chain management, learning how to harness these resources to create innovative projects. By sharing their knowledge and developments, they can empower the maker community to learn from their experiences.

Maker Camp in Shenzhen is not just about creating innovative projects – it also offers workshops, hackathons, and other sessions to help participants experience the latest in technical solutions and hone their skills. Additionally, participants will collaborate with talented makers from around the world, sharing knowledge, skills, and building a global network of support.

We cherish the sharing and inheritance of each innovative story. Each project team participating in "Maker Camp" will record and showcase their development process on GitHub with a unique number (e.g., "2024-01", "2024-02", "2025-01"), creating valuable digital footprints and providing a treasure trove of practical experience and learning for the global maker community.

## Guidelines for Content Organization and Contribution on GitHub

We encourage students to adhere to a standardized naming convention and categorization when uploading their content to GitHub. The suggested naming format is "Participation Term - Organization," for example, "2024-01-MIT." In terms of categorization, we recommend organizing content under specific themes like factory production, electronic resources, community resources, or other observations. This practice ensures clarity, consistency, and efficient organization of shared information.

Additionally, if you come across any original documents with missing sections and wish to enhance them, please don't hesitate to reference that document in your uploaded content. Your contributions to improving and completing the existing documentation are highly valued.
