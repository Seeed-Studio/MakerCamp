The suggested naming format is "Participation Term - Organization," for example, "2401-MIT." In terms of categorization, we recommend organizing content under specific themes like factory production, electronic resources, community resources, or other observations. This practice ensures clarity, consistency, and efficient organization of shared information.

Additionally, if you come across any original documents with missing sections and wish to enhance them, please don't hesitate to reference that document in your uploaded content. Your contributions to improving and completing the existing documentation are highly valued.
