Some basics to start your documentation:


### 1) edit the README.md file in the folder with your name:

- https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/MakerCamp/edit/main/2024-01-MIT_Research_At_Scale/Andres/README.md => Andres
- https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/MakerCamp/edit/main/2024-01-MIT_Research_At_Scale/Cathy/README.md => Cathy
- https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/MakerCamp/edit/main/2024-01-MIT_Research_At_Scale/David/README.md => David
