## A Home but with a Different View

Born and Raised in Shanghai, I have always heard about Shenzhen being the other city that got super rich and well-invested during the 80s when China first opened herself up to the world. Different from my hometown Shanghai, known more for its financial districts and poshness, Shenzhen just sounded more relaxed and inclusive.
This time around, I had the chance to visit Shenzhen with my colleagues and friends at MIT. I was excited to show them China, the food and the people, the pervalence of QRCode and Wechat, and the spiderweb network of metros. At the same time, I felt like a foreigner too; for the first time, I visited the infamous HQB and circuit manufacturing factories, and I felt like truly a kid in the candy shop.
Without further ado, here's my recount of the short but memorable week in Shenzhen.
