My research involves building hardware devices, and I honestly can’t imagine a better place to do hardware work. Being in Shenzhen feels like paradise for hardware. 

On a surface level, it’s incredible to be able to see actual components in person and find experts (store owners!) to learn from. It was quite an eye-opening experience.
For example, I was trying to find some small connectors that allow for high current—and boom, here’s a whole family of them:

And more:

Imagine having a robotics company right at HQB (there are already tons), where you can just walk into a store, see the actual component size, and feel it in your hands. (Guess how many of us are robots in this picture below at HQB)

# Cool People and Communities!



Another great thing about Shenzhen is the hardware community itself, which naturally leads to resources and opportunities down the line. Talking to one person often turns into “oh, I know someone who does that.” I really enjoy going to these meetups and feeling the vibrancy of the ecosystem. It was also great to meet so many interesting people spanning researchers, artists, entrepreneurs, or just cool folks working on personal projects they’re genuinely excited about.

# Some really cool places
We also went to some really cool places:

# My Making and Exploration

Lastly, one of my goals is to turn some parts that were previously hand-made into PCBs. The shipping speed and iteration cycle here are incredibly fast.
The project I’m basing this on is a paper to be published at CHI:
https://doi.org/10.1145/3772318.3790357

My main goal is to make a soft blade for capacitive sensing. The blade needs to be very soft and safe to touch even while spinning at high speed. One great thing about making this in Shenzhen is being able to quickly test and iterate on material softness.

I was also able to source a variety of conductive soft materials on Taobao:
