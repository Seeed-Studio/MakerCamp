First and foremost, I'd like to say thank you to ScalableHCI, SUSTECH, AIRS, and Seeed for hosting such a fun visit and program in Shenzhen! 
Huge shoutout to Cedric who has been such an amazing organizer! Thanks to Cedric and the organizing team! 
Great hardware communities start to form encompassing researchers, artists, entrepreneurs, makers, hobbiests, etc. around the best hardware ecosystem! 
I really appreciate and enjoy it.

# The Paradise for Hardware

It was quite an eye-opening experience! 
My research involves building a lot of hardware devices, and I honestly can’t imagine a better place to do hardware work. 
On a surface level, it’s incredible to be able to see actual components in person and find experts (store owners!) to learn from. 
For example, I was trying to find some small connectors that allow for high current—and boom, here’s a whole family of them:

And more:

Imagine having a robotics company right at HQB (there are already tons), where you can just walk into a store, see the actual component size, and feel it in your hands.
It was also great to meet so many interesting people—researchers, artists, entrepreneurs, or just cool folks working on personal projects they’re genuinely excited about.

Another great thing about Shenzhen is the hardware community itself, which naturally leads to resources and opportunities down the line. Talking to one person often turns into “oh, I know someone who does that.” I really enjoy going to these meetups and feeling the vibrancy of the ecosystem.

Lastly, one of my goals is to turn some parts that were previously hand-made into PCBs. The shipping speed and iteration cycle here are incredibly fast.
The project I’m basing this on is a paper to be published at CHI:
https://doi.org/10.1145/3772318.3790357

My main goal is to make a soft blade for capacitive sensing. The blade needs to be very soft and safe to touch even while spinning at high speed. One great thing about making this in Shenzhen is being able to quickly test and iterate on material softness.

I also made another housing board for my XIAO board:

We also went to some really cool places:

I want to thank all the organizers again. I’ll definitely be back!
