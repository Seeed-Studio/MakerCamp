First Shenzhen Experience, New Hardware Adventure, and Awesome People!

> It was a decision made just five days before it happened,
> but it led to so much fun and very engaging learning experience, with
> such a great people (and cheap food)!

> I have also taken the infamous How to Make Almost Anything at MIT, but it was more than a year ago,
> and coming from more software background, it was a very nervous and intimidating decision to make.
> Arriving at China, forgetting about the VPN, and definitely not familiar with the entire WeChat and Allipay ecosystem,
> and arriving a day late due to my other commitments, it was definitely not a easy start.
> But soon, seeing so many very nice people at the Scalable HCI and few friends I knew from MIT, things started to get easier.


> I would say beyond the ScalableHCI, the most eye-opening experience was the HQB.
> I have never seen such a Disney place of Hardware, with every components you could have imagined!!!!



> I also met a very sweet and smart collaborator Yuxiang after giving a talk about rings (and frequently encountering from our apartment),
> and very supportive Seeed family including Ellie and Violet.
