> I have also taken the infamous How to Make Almost Anything at MIT, but it was more than a year ago,
> and coming from more software background, it was a very nervous and intimidating decision to make.
> Arriving at China, forgetting about the VPN, and definitely not familiar with the entire WeChat and Allipay ecosystem, and arriving a day late due to my other commitments, it was definitely not a easy start.
