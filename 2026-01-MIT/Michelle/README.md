> I have also taken the infamous How to Make Almost Anything at MIT, but it was more than a year ago,
> and coming from more software background, it was a very nervous and intimidating decision to make.
> Arriving at China, forgetting about the VPN, and definitely not familiar with the entire WeChat and Allipay ecosystem, and arriving a day late due to my other commitments, it was definitely not a easy start.
> But soon, seeing so many very nice people at the Scalable HCI and few friends I knew from MIT, things started to get easier.

> I would say beyond the ScalableHCI, the most eye-opening experience was the HQB.
> I have never seen such a Disney place of Hardware, with every components you could have imagined!!!!
> Few of us also went to a place with a lot of motors as well.

## CHAPTER 2: Smart Ring For Behavior Change.

> During the first week of factory visits, and getting adjusted to Shenzhen, I met my amazing collaborator Yuxiang after giving a talk about rings (and frequently encountering from our apartment), and very supportive Seeed family including Ellie and Violet.
> We were able to start from sourcing components, testing, designing PCBs, and getting an FPC prototype !
