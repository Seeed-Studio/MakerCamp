The Journey in Shenzhen for me revealed an intersection between design and  technology by being introduced to large scale manufacturing, fabrication techniques, art museums, technology developments, and unique cultural exchange. As a Fashion designer and Textile Researcher specializing in e-textile and smart textile systems for wearables, witnessing insights from both the electronics and textile industries was a meaningful and eye-opening experience. 
In this documentation I will introduce my own insights in participation in the HCI Symposium and Seeed Hackathon, along with interesting visits to various manufacturing sites such as electronic and fabric markets, PCB and textile factories and additionally, I will highlight the art and cultural experiences that enriched our stay.
