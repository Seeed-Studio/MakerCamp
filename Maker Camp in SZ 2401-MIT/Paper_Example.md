## Background

In these times, we have witnessed Huaqiang North's humble cubicles and affordable yet powerful equipment, as well as Seeed's growth from a small startup to a billion business in 10 years.

Our Maker Camp was created with the hope of nurturing more success stories. As founders, we aim to inspire and support individuals on their entrepreneurial journeys. 

With you guys, the forerunners, we will embrace the possibilities and build a future filled with innovation and achievement!
