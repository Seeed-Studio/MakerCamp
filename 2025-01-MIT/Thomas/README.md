## Roboscope 


During the Research at Scale 2025 residency in Shenzhen, I had the extraordinary opportunity to further develop and collaborate on the [RoboScope](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/roboscope/overview/) project which I have been deeply involved with for the past few years. This residency offered the opportunity to collaborate with SUSTech University in future developing the design. Working in Shenzhenâ€™s dynamic hardware and manufacturing  ecosystem allowed me to understand the supply chain process of the region as well to graps the benfits of developoing hardware locally in Shenzhen.








#### Thank you
A huge thanks to Cedric Honnet for organzing and managing the whole residency and trip to Shenzhen. I also want to thank Seed Studio, AIRS and SUSTech University for all the support and the amazing opportunity to learn from the local tech ecosystem.
