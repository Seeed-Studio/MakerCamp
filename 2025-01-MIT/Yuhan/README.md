# Yuhan's project

Yuhan has proposed a project in the very primitave state of the trip. This project is about a self-assembly robot that can reproduce itself like the way plant cells make their reproduction through cell devision.

) is a Miro link, but the key information from this Miro will be embedded into this article.

The key idea of this project is bringing the essential way of reproduction from living creatures to the robotics. For instance, in the cell division process, each cell has the DNA for the whole creature, and the DNA is copied and transferred to all the 
other cells. Yuhan have been exploring the ways self-assembly robotics manage to form larger structures from modular units, and he wish to create a similar process of this cell reproduction through a machinary robotic way.
