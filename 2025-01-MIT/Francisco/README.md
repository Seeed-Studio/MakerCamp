### Tips for Travelers

<p align="center" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;">
  <img src="./images/google_translate.jpeg" alt="Google Translate in action" width="200">
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Using Google Translate to communicate was key! Make sure to download the offline version!</em></p>

- **Get a CSL prepaid SIM card** at 7-Eleven in Hong Kong for about **$10 USD**. It works in **China, Hong Kong, and Macau**.  
- **Currency confusion?** The Hong Kong dollar (HKD) is worth **0.13 USD per 1 HKD**, so don‚Äôt panic if things seem expensive at the airport!  
- **Ferry to Shenzhen:** I took the ferry to and from Shenzhen and the Hong Kong airport, followed by an additional **50-minute Didi ride**.  
- **Beware of unofficial taxis** at the Shenzhen terminal. Dodgy individuals may approach you for a ride. **Stick to Didi** for safety and convenience.  
- **Didi is prepaid**, so you don‚Äôt need to worry about payment issues while setting up your account.  
- **International payment options:** My **Revolut** card and **Swiss Visa** worked fine with both **Alipay and WeChat Pay**.  
- **Ferry ticket tip:** As soon as you land, **go straight to the ferry ticket booth**‚Äîthey need time to process your luggage. While waiting, you can buy and set up your **7-Eleven SIM card**, but don‚Äôt do it the other way around like I did!
