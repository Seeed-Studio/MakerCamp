# Research at Scale – Shenzhen, January 2025

## Summary  
This trip was the highlight of my semester and, honestly, my time at MIT so far. I’m 27 years old, and I can confidently say this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  

First, **Shenzhen is an incredibly technologically advanced city**—from drones delivering packages to insanely efficient manufacturing processes, cutting-edge robotics, and the super apps that handle everything from payments to transportation. The city's infrastructure and services are on another level.  

Second, **the people I met were some of the most driven individuals I've ever encountered**. Everyone seemed to have a strong sense of purpose, and being around them was inspiring.  

Third, **the variety of activities I took part in—factory visits, a hackathon, and the HCI symposium—were invaluable**. As a first-year PhD student, these experiences have already shaped my professional path in meaningful ways.

## ✈️ The Flights & Getting Set Up  
I flew over from Geneva as I had spent Christmas in Europe, with a layover in Paris. For the return, I flew directly from Hong Kong to Boston. This was the longest flight I’ve ever taken at **15 hours**. Flying into Hong Kong was easy.  

### **Tips for Travelers:**
- **Get a CSL prepaid SIM card** at 7-Eleven in Hong Kong for about **$10 USD**. It works in **China, Hong Kong, and Macau**.
- **Currency confusion?** The Hong Kong dollar (HKD) is worth **0.13 USD per 1 HKD**, so don’t panic if things seem expensive at the airport!
- **Ferry to Shenzhen:** I took the ferry to and from Shenzhen and the Hong Kong airport, followed by an additional **50-minute Didi ride**.
- **Beware of unofficial taxis** at the Shenzhen terminal. Dodgy individuals may approach you for a ride. **Stick to Didi** for safety and convenience.
- **Didi is prepaid**, so you don’t need to worry about payment issues while setting up your account.
- **International payment options:** My **Revolut** card and **Swiss Visa** worked fine with both **Alipay and WeChat Pay**.
- **Ferry ticket tip:** As soon as you land, **go straight to the ferry ticket booth**—they need time to process your luggage. While waiting, you can buy and set up your **7-Eleven SIM card**, but don’t do it the other way around like I did!

## 🌆 The City, Accommodation & Communication  
We stayed at the **City Hotel**, a fantastic location that was extremely central to all relevant trip activities. The receptionists were very helpful and assisted me in placing orders directly to the hotel. Additionally, there was a temple nearby, as well as gym facilities that provided a great way to unwind after long days.  

To communicate with drivers, restaurant workers, and when negotiating, I highly recommend downloading the **Google Translate** app, as well as an Android app called **Instant Translate**, which allows you to translate anything on screen with a single tap. However, most service industry workers were prepared to translate using their own phones, so I didn’t encounter many difficulties.  

### **Tips for Travelers:**
- **Google Translate & Instant Translate** – Essential for seamless communication.
- **Most service workers will help** – Don't hesitate to show text translations on your phone.
- **City Hotel’s location was perfect** – Great access to key areas and helpful staff.
