# Research at Scale – Shenzhen, January 2025

## Summary  
This trip was the highlight of my semester and, honestly, my time at MIT so far. I’m 27 years old, and I can confidently say this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  

First, **Shenzhen is an incredibly technologically advanced city**—from drones delivering packages to insanely efficient manufacturing processes, cutting-edge robotics, and the super apps that handle everything from payments to transportation. The city's infrastructure and services are on another level.  

Second, **the people I met were some of the most driven individuals I've ever encountered**. Everyone seemed to have a strong sense of purpose, and being around them was inspiring.  

Third, **the variety of activities I took part in—factory visits, a hackathon, and the HCI symposium—were invaluable**. As a first-year PhD student, these experiences have already shaped my professional path in meaningful ways.
